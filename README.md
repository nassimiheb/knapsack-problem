## knapsack problem solver

A web application that offers the possibility to run different algorithms to solve the knapsack problem and compare between them.
  
## Testing
Clone the source locally.
On a working python environment:
  
```sh
$ pip install streamlit
```
then : 
Install the requirements in the requirements.txt

then :
  
```sh
$ streamlit run app.py
```
